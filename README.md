This program usually takes around 8 seconds for 50 guests, 25 seconds for 100 guests, and 81 seconds for 200 guests. Randomness is used in the runtime because the program can take longer if the same guests visit the vase multiple times, if their chance value stays as 1. However, this program is efficient because guests only try to view the vase if the showroom is available, as opposed to option 1 where guests constantly try to see te vase. This makes it go by faster because this deters large crowds or threads from going into the room. Option 3 is less efficient because while the queue would make sure everyone goes in at least once, it would take a long time for guests in the back of the line to view the vase.
With this option, there is no line and guests already know if the room is available or not.
